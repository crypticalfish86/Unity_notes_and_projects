[1]CODING PLAYER INPUTS

    Input.GetAxis() will have a value of either -1, 0 or 1 depending on the predefined Input. The Input object which allows us to define 
    where the input is coming from (e.g the keyboard) and our script dictates what the inputs would do in the game

    For GetAxis to determine where to get input from, to do this in Unity go to Edit -> Projects Settings -> Input Manager.
    Then We need to find the right type of input (e.g. Vertical, Horizontal etc.) and pass in the keyword of its name as a string
    to Input.GetAxis("String here"). This will now give us a positive, negative or neutral value for us to use in our script to code what player input does
    (quick note if your controls are inverted a quick easy fix is to invert the value by adding a - sign)


[2]Coding actual movement with translation/position
    
    In 2D unity movements are implemented via transform.translate(x,y,z) where x, y and z are floats. Transform.Translate returns as a "Vector3" datatype (x, y, z), which represents 
    movements in either direction. You would usually put a translation after an input into the Update(){} function so that an object would translate across the game by this much in x,y,z every frame. 
    
    If you want an object or camera to teleport to a certain position immediatley you would change the transform.position of the object the script is attached to.
    If you wanted to add extra coords in any direction you can directly add a Vector3 datatype to another like so:

    transform.position = new Vector3 ("x,y,z" values) + new Vector3 ("x,y,z" values)


[3]Coding Rotation with torque

    The force that rotates an object in unity is called "torque". Torque is a feature on an objects rigid body, so in order to
    edit it we first need to get the component like we did before,
    
    we can then do: 

    rigidbody.AddTorque(torqueamount)

    To add rotation either clockwise or anti clockwise (positive numbers for anticlockwise, negative numbers for clockwise).

[4]USING THE SURFACE EFFECTOR

    An effector is a feature of the physics engine that adds various effects in the game (e.g buoyancy, floating conveyer 
    belt etc.), The specific effector we will use is the Surface Effector 2D. 

    Add it to the surface you want to act as a conveyeer belt and anything with physics (a rigid body) will be pushed along on 
    its surface (we can use this to simulate converyer belts, ice, slippery surfaces etc.)

    Change the speed to whatever you want the surface to thave the effect for (positive values for left to right and negative 
    values for right to left)

    Force scale refers to how much gravity effects the speed ofthe object on the conveyer belt, a higher number means
    less effect by gravity

[5]Frame rate independent movements

        The issue with updating something every single frame using Update(){} is more powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
        computer making the properties of your game different based on how many frames are calculated every second. We Therefore need 
        some way to standardise the process across all computers, to do this we can multiply our values by the timing of frames directly.

        Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
        on a slower computer.

        When we multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
        and slow computer. This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

        (As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
        you may now need to change these variables as they might be too sensitive/insensitive)

TIME.DELTATIME()

The issue with updating something every single frame is more
powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
computer making the properties of your game different based on 
how many frames are calculated every second. therefore we need 
some way to standardise the process across all computers. 
Therefore we need to use time directly.

Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) 
took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
on a slower computer

We multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame
rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
and slow computer.

This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

(As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables
not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
you may now need to change these variables as they might be
too sensitive/insensitive)

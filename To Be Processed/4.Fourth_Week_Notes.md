SNOWBOARDER GAME DESIGN

game mechanichs:
-Move along track
-Rotate forwards and backwards like a snowboarder
-Ability to speed up
-Particle effects only when we're touching the ground
-Finish line that restarts the level
-Crash detection which restarts the level

Player experience: Smooth, relaxing

Core Mechanic: Don't crash

Game Loop: Reach the end to win

HOW TO USE SPRITE SHAPES

Sprite shapes allow us to make more complex shapes than basic squares and circles.

First to make a sprite shape go to "create 2D sprite, then go 
to "sprite shape" and click a closed shape if you want a shape 
thats completely enclosed

On sprite shapes now we can click "edit spline" to start 
editing our shape to our hearts content, we can move any of the nodes or even add more nodes by clicking places.

To delete nodes simply click on a node and hit the delete 
button while it's selected

EDGE COLLIDERS

to add a collider to a sprite shape we would add a "Edge 
Collider 2D". This gives our sprite shape an edge collision box 
that automatically conforms to the sprite shape.

SPRITE PROFILES

We want our shapes to have textures and skins instead of being a basic shape.

In order to give you sprite shape a texture go to "create" in 
the right click of the assets section of the page, then 2D then 
"create sprite shape profile" (make sure to name your shape 
accordingly)

You can now click on this sprite profile and do all sorts of edits to the profile. You can add sprite assets to the sprites and texture to fill the edges and inner layer.

Make sure to add this profile to any shape you want to have 
this profile.

SPRITE EDITOR

Just to note, so far you've used prepackaged sprites instead of your own assets, there is a sprite editor which you use to edit the textures that make up your sprite. 

Also when importing assets make sure to pay attention to your 
"Wrap mode", make sure its on repeat especially if its on a big 
object and the fill texture has multiple colours instead of 
just one.

MAKING SPRITES OUT OF MULTIPLE ASSETS

Add a parent asset, remove any rendering shapes, then add
the assets in as children under the parent asset, move each 
individual piece around to shape your sprite and so long as you
just move the parent asset everything should stay in place, add 
physics to the parent asset and manipulate that to the shape of 
your sprite. 

Make sure the middle of your sprite assets is roughly where the 
centre of the parent object is (you can do this by clicking on 
all child objects and moving them all to the centre of the 
parent)

Also make sure any physics applies to the whole sprite by 
adding physics at the parent level

USING THE SURFACE EFFECTOR

An effector is a feature of the physics engine that adds 
various effects in the game (e.g buoyancy, floating conveyer 
belt etc.). The specific effector we will use  is the Surface 
Effector 2D. 

Add it to the surface you want to act as a conveyeer belt and 
anything with physics (a rigid body) will be pushed along on 
its surface (we can use this to simulate converyer belts, ice, 
slippery surfaces etc.)

Change the speed to whatever you want the surface to thave the 
effect for (positive values for left to right and negative 
values for right to left)

Force scale refers to how much gravity effects the speed of
the object on the conveyer belt, a higher number means
less effect by gravity

ADD TORQUE TO ROTATE

The force that rotates an object in unity is called "torque".
Torque is a feature on an objects rigid body, so in order to
edit it we first need to get the component like we did before,
we can then do: 

rigidbody.AddTorque(torqueamount)

To add rotation either clockwise or anti clockwise (positive 
numbers for anticlockwise, negative numbers for clockwise).

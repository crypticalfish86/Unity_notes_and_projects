[6]GAME DESIGN

    -always design the game before writing any code
    -First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible 
    sprites that can appear

    when thinking of game design think of:
    -Player experience (e.g. relaxing, intense, puzzle)
    -Core mechanics (e.g. drive over pickups)
    -Game loop(e.g. find and deliver all packages)

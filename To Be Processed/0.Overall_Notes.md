    TIME.DELTATIME()

        The issue with updating something every single frame is more
        powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
        computer making the properties of your game different based on 
        how many frames are calculated every second. therefore we need 
        some way to standardise the process across all computers. 
        Therefore we need to use time directly.

        Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) 
        took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
        on a slower computer

        We multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame
        rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
        and slow computer.

        This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

        (As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables
        not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
        you may now need to change these variables as they might be
        too sensitive/insensitive)

[6]GAME DESIGN

    -always design the game before writing any code
    -First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible 
    sprites that can appear

    when thinking of game design think of:
    -Player experience (e.g. relaxing, intense, puzzle)
    -Core mechanics (e.g. drive over pickups)
    -Game loop(e.g. find and deliver all packages)

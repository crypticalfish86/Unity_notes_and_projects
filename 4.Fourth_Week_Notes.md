HOW TO USE SPRITE SHAPES

Sprite shapes allow us to make more complex shapes than basic squares and circles.

First to make a sprite shape go to "create 2D sprite, then go 
to "sprite shape" and click a closed shape if you want a shape 
thats completely enclosed

On sprite shapes now we can click "edit spline" to start 
editing our shape to our hearts content, we can move any of the nodes or even add more nodes by clicking places.

To delete nodes simply click on a node and hit the delete 
button while it's selected

EDGE COLLIDERS

to add a collider to a sprite shape we would add a "Edge 
Collider 2D". This gives our sprite shape an edge collision box 
that automatically conforms to the sprite shape.

SPRITE PROFILES

We want our shapes to have textures and skins instead of being a basic shape.

In order to give you sprite shape a texture go to "create" in 
the right click of the assets section of the page, then 2D then 
"create sprite shape profile" (make sure to name your shape 
accordingly)

You can now click on this sprite profile and do all sorts of edits to the profile. You can add sprite assets to the sprites and texture to fill the edges and inner layer.

Make sure to add this profile to any shape you want to have 
this profile.

SPRITE EDITOR

Just to note, so far you've used prepackaged sprites instead of your own assets, there is a sprite editor which you use to edit the textures that make up your sprite. 

Also when importing assets make sure to pay attention to your 
"Wrap mode", make sure its on repeat especially if its on a big 
object and the fill texture has multiple colours instead of 
just one.

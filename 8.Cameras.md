[1]Simple Following camera

    For a simple camera that follows the player through the game we'd need to keep the cameras central position at the centre of the player object.
    To do this we need to update the cameras transform.position value every frame to the centre of theplayer object. 

    To do this we will need to access the transform.position of the player object, we'll need to create a reference to the player object which
    can be done by creating a [SerializeField] in the C# script and set it to the player object you want the camera to follow.

    Like so:
    
    [SerializeField] GameObject gameObject;

    (Note GameObject is the parent class of many objects in unity)

    Now that we have a reference to the player object in our script we can set the transform.position of the camera to our player
    object. (Note in 2D especially we have to give our camera a small offset in the Z direction because otherwise
    it will go directly on the car and you wont be able to see 
    anything)
    
    It would be done like follows:

    transform.position = playerObject.transform.position + new Vector3 (0, 0, -10);

    transform.position in unity is an object called Vector3, we are just adding an extra vector to it in a way it understands.



[2]CINEMACHINE FOLLOW CAMERA

    theres a more complex type of follow camera called "cinemachine" which allows us to use various features not available with a simple follow camera.
    Cinemachine is a powerful package that lets us manage multiple cameras at once in our scene as well as easily creating rules for our cameras.

    Cinemachine essentially works like this:

    Cinemachine logic system ------------------> Main Camera
        ^                ^
        |                |
    Virtual camera 2    Virtual camera 1


    Several virtual cameras can be run at once that are interpreted by the cinemachine logic system and the logic system decides to
    project onto the "main camera" which is the computer screen the user views. The cinemachine logic system is a component on the main camera

    To initiate the cinemachine logic system on the main camera simply add it as a component or try adding a virtual camera.

    For a basic following virtual camera change the body to "framing transposer" meaning we are trying to "frame" a 
    particular thing in our world. Then make it follow the object you want to frame. There will by default be some "smoothing/
    easing" so its not so jarring when quick moves are made.

    We also probably want our object more to the left of the screen so we'd change in the body section of the virtual camera 
    "Screen X" and "Screen Y" to our preffered values to that the camera will follow the object in a way that keeps it in the 
    ideal part of the screen.

    There are many many other features that we will add here when they come up.

[3]GET RID OF BLURRY MOVEMENT WITH CINEMACHINE

    A quick fix is to change the update method on the cinemachine logic system component to "fixed update" instead of "smart 
    update". This only works if you want to move the camera this way

[4]Change Resolution view of our game
    
    In game view in the top centre of the screen there are buttons like scale and resolution (which is by default set to "free aspect"). Set your game view to be the resolution you want

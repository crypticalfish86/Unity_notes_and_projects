[1]Simple Following camera

    For a simple camera that follows the player through the game we'd need to keep the cameras central position at the centre of the player object.
    To do this we need to update the cameras transform.position value every frame to the centre of theplayer object. 

    To do this we will need to access the transform.position of the player object, we'll need to create a reference to the player object which
    can be done by creating a [SerializeField] in the C# script and set it to the player object you want the camera to follow.

    Like so:
    
    [SerializeField] GameObject gameObject;

    (Note GameObject is the parent class of many objects in unity)

    Now that we have a reference to the player object in our script we can set the transform.position of the camera to our player
    object. (Note in 2D especially we have to give our camera a small offset in the Z direction because otherwise
    it will go directly on the car and you wont be able to see 
    anything)
    
    It would be done like follows:

    transform.position = playerObject.transform.position + new Vector3 (0, 0, -10);

    transform.position in unity is an object called Vector3, we are just adding an extra vector to it in a way it understands.



[2]CINEMACHINE FOLLOW CAMERA

    theres a more complex type of follow camera called "cinemachine" which allows us to use various features not available with a simple follow camera.
    Cinemachine is a powerful package that lets us manage multiple cameras at once in our scene as well as easily creating rules for our cameras.

    Cinemachine essentially works like this:

    Cinemachine logic system ------------------> Main Camera
        ^                ^
        |                |
    Virtual camera 2    Virtual camera 1


    Several virtual cameras can be run at once that are interpreted by the cinemachine logic system and the logic system decides to
    project onto the "main camera" which is the computer screen the user views. The cinemachine logic system is a component on the main camera

    To initiate the cinemachine logic system on the main camera simply add it as a component or try adding a virtual camera.

    For a basic following virtual camera change the body to "framing transposer" meaning we are trying to "frame" a 
    particular thing in our world. Then make it follow the object you want to frame. There will by default be some "smoothing/
    easing" so its not so jarring when quick moves are made.

    We also probably want our object more to the left of the screen so we'd change in the body section of the virtual camera 
    "Screen X" and "Screen Y" to our preffered values to that the camera will follow the object in a way that keeps it in the 
    ideal part of the screen.

    There are many many other features that we will add here when they come up.


    STUFF TO TWEAK A FOLLOW CAMERA FOR

        Dead zone: switches how much the player object can move 
        in the centre of the camera before cinemachine starts 
        following the player. This is good to prevent very 
        aggressive camera follow even in the centre of the 
        screen.

        x,y Damping: changes how aggressively the camera follow 
        is, a higher damping means the camera will move slower 
        to get the player to the centre of the screen (but the 
        further away the player is from the centre the faster 
        the camera will try and follow keeping player always on 
        screen)

[3]GET RID OF BLURRY MOVEMENT WITH CINEMACHINE

    A quick fix is to change the update method on the cinemachine logic system component to "fixed update" instead of "smart 
    update". This only works if you want to move the camera this way

[4]Prevent cinemachine camera moving past boundary with confiner

    We can have the cinemachine camera stop at a certain 
    boundary to prevent the player seeing things they shouldn't 
    be seeing in a level.

    What we need to do first is add a collider to the tilemap/gameobjects that make up the background of the world and have that collider spread out at exactly the world boundaries you want the camera to stop at.

    Then under your virtual camera scroll down to "extensions" and add a "cinemachine confiner" and on that new extension, add to the "bounding shape" the game object with the collider you want the camera not to see past (This game object should be something in the background instead of a physical thing the player can interact with otherwise it could cause massive camera bugs)

    MAKE SURE THE FOLLOW CAMERA AND COLLISION IN BACKGROUND AREN'T ON THE SAME COLLISION LAYER OR IT WILL CAUSE CAMERA BUGS


[5]Change Resolution view of our game
    
    In game view in the top centre of the screen there are buttons like scale and resolution (which is by default set to "free aspect"). Set your game view to be the resolution you want

[6]Have camera ignore layers
    We can change the layers our camera renders by changing the
    "culling mask" option on the camera component, We can
    choose to tick on or off certain boxes based on what layers
    we want our camera to render/ignore

[7]Camera change and state driven cameras with cinemachine
    
    We can tell the cinemachine to change the virtual camera 
    that is displayed by the main camera based on states (and 
    by state we mean the same type of "states" on the animator)

    In order to set up a camera that projects itself when a 
    certain state is active we need to click on cinemachine in 
    the hierachy and add a "state driven camera". 

    Next add ALL virtual cameras you want to be state driven as 
    children of the "state driven camera". 

    Next whats important is to have our state driven camera to 
    have an "animated target" which we drag the game object 
    with an "animator" component we want our state driven 
    camera to respond to states on (this is usually the player 
    object).

    Next on the state section of the 
    CinemachineStateDrivenCamera component we can add states in 
    which we can add states on our animator and the camera we 
    should follow when that state is active

    STUFF TO TWEAK A STATE DRIVEN CAMERA FOR:
        
        -Default blend: change the speed of transition between 
        cameras on state change (default is 0.5s but can be 
        shortened/lengthened, this makes the camera change 
        more/less jarring)

        -Custom blends: We can instead of default blend create 
        "custom blends" which are assets that we need to save 
        to the project folder. Now we have custom blends which 
        we can determine from which state to which state we are 
        transitioning from and the transition time. We can also 
        choose to "wait" before beggining camera transitions to 
        new states, for example if we have an "idling" camera 
        we'd probably want to wait before zooming in on the 
        player as maybe the player has just momentarily stopped

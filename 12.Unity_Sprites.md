[1]HOW TO USE MORE COMPLEX SPRITE SHAPES

    Sprite shapes allow us to make more complex shapes than basic squares and circles.

    First to make a sprite shape go to "create 2D sprite, then go to "sprite shape" and click a closed shape if you want a shape 
    thats completely enclosed

    On sprite shapes now we can click "edit spline" to start editing our shape to our hearts content, we can move any of the nodes or even add more nodes by clicking places.
    To delete nodes simply click on a node and hit the delete button while it's selected.


[2]SPRITE PROFILES

    If we're not just importing assets we want our shapes to have textures and skins instead of being a basic shape.

    In order to give you sprite shape a texture go to "create" in the right click of the assets section of the page, then 2D then 
    "create sprite shape profile" (make sure to name your shape accordingly)

    You can now click on this sprite profile and do all sorts of edits to the profile. You can add sprite assets to the sprites and texture to fill the edges and inner layer.

    Make sure to add this profile to any shape you want to have this profile.

[3]Sprite Editor

    Just to note, so far you've used prepackaged sprites instead of your own assets, there is a sprite editor which you use to edit the textures that make up your sprite. 

    Also when importing assets make sure to pay attention to your "Wrap mode", make sure its on repeat especially if its on a big 
    object and the fill texture has multiple colours instead of just one.

[4]MAKING SPRITES OUT OF MULTIPLE ASSETS

    Add a parent asset, remove any rendering shapes, then add the assets in as children under the parent asset, move each 
    individual piece around to shape your sprite and so long as you just move the parent asset everything should stay in place, add 
    physics to the parent asset and manipulate that to the shape of your sprite. 

    Make sure the middle of your sprite assets is roughly where the centre of the parent object is (you can do this by clicking on 
    all child objects and moving them all to the centre of the parent)

    Also make sure any physics applies to the whole sprite by adding physics at the parent level

[5]Changing the image associated with a sprite component
    
    To change the image associated with a sprite all you have to do is get the image component of a sprite and change it out for another sprite

    like so:

    [SerializeField] image;

    spriteObject.sprite = image

    this will change spriteObjects image to whatever you add to the serialized field

[6]Derendering/filling only part of a sprite image
    
    We can choose to derender parts of an image leaving other parts still completely rendered by changing the Image type
    from simple to "filled" this gives us a slider which will say what ratio of the image do you want to display and what
    amount you want to derender. There are mutliple options for derendring parts in "fill method", either radially
    like a circle, from the top, from the bottom etc.

[7]Sprite sheets
    
    Sprite sheets are single images split up into squares/a grid
    that we case use as building blocks to build up our level.
    The benefit of sprite sheets is we can repeatedly use them
    over and over without taking up too much memory compared to
    individual assets. Sprite sheets tend to be used to make
    up the physical world of a game

    A sprite sheet starts as a base png image and you need to
    tell unity where to cut it up into tiles, click on the 
    sprite and change "sprite mode" from single to multiple 
    (meaning this asset represents more than one sprite). Then 
    in the sprite editor a new option should come up called 
    "slice". You can manually decide to slice by grid cell, but 
    good premade pngs of sprite sheets will have transparency 
    or some form of hard border between individual grid tiles 
    that represent its own sprite and so you can attempt to 
    click "automatic" and unity should be able to guess exactly 
    what represents an individual sprite/tile (It will slice 
    exactly around the pixel limits).

    Note for example for characters "jumping" and not being
    on the ground the automatic slice WONT work and you'll
    have to slice it by grid manually(this is a skill you'll 
    get good at the more you do it)

    Once we've sliced up our sprite sheet we can click the 
    arrow next to the asset and it will open up a sub-menu with 
    all your individual sprite assets.

    NOTE THAT ITS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A SINGLE SLICED SPRITE
    TO BE RELATIVE TO ONE UNITY UNIT AS ITS A GOOD REFERENCE
    GRID

[8]Using sprite sheets with Unity Tilemap

    A tilemap is a way of creating a pallete of sprites from a tiles on a sprite sheet. The tilemap pipeline goes like this:

    sprite sheet -> sliced sprite -> tile asset -> Tile pallete

    Our tile assets are then on a pallete and instances of
    those tiles can then be placed into the world. Tile
    assets can be rearranged, flipped, rotated and formatted.

    A tilemap is an actual gameobject under 2D, the most common 
    tilemap to use being a rectangular tilemap. This will 
    create a "grid" which by default is one unity unit, our
    tilemap pallete will fill information per square of the 
    grid (so make sure your assets are the right size for the 
    grid)

    Once we've done that we can click on window and bring in 
    the tile pallete (which you should dock somewhere on the 
    screen) We then can click "create new pallete" to create
    a new pallet, and then directly drag our tile assets we sliced into the tile pallete, we can then click and
    "paint" our tiles onto the grid we've previously
    implemented.

    REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF LAYERING OUR TILEMAPS,
    all your tilemaps should be (unless you're doing something 
    specific) the same sized grid, but if we want certain
    tilemaps to be in the forefront and certain tilemaps to
    be in the background we can change the "order of layers" of 
    your tilemap

[9]Rule tiles
    Rule tiles are a way to paint a tileset that automatically 
    recognises edges, corners and other elements and display 
    the correct art asset, it requires us to set up the logic 
    for our rule tiles

    first we need to install this package so go to:

    package manager -> search:2D TilemapExtras -> install

    then in your sprites folder:

    create -> Tiles -> Rule Tile

    this will make a prefab rule tile

    we then need to drag the rule tile object into the pallete 
    we want to use it in, it will initially be invisible so 
    give it a "default tile skin" in the inspector (drag in a 
    default sprite)

    We can  now in the inspector for the rule tile start giving 
    logic to the "tiling rules" for example in a tiling rule we 
    drag a tile we want to show when it has these "rules" and 
    then make these rules. Example the 3x3 grid next to the 
    tile, we say if a tile has a certain set of tiles anywhere 
    on that 3x3 grid in relation to the centre, then that rule 
    tile when placed into the world will display that tile.

    For example we can say that in the top left corner there 
    shouldn't be a tile, and in the bottom 3 there should be, 
    we'd place 3 green arrows in the bottom 3 and a red arrow 
    in the top left to represent those rules.

    (there is something about rotating the centre of the 3x3, 
    something about making rotated versions of the same tiles 
    following the same rules, but we don't properly understand 
    from the course so for now just keep that in mind until you 
    learn)

    We can change output from single to random in order to get 
    some "randomness" to tile generation when the same rules 
    are applied. When the tile position meets a certain 
    criteria it will then randomly pick one of the random tiles 
    you've assigned to that rule.

    Once we've set up our rules we can start painting with the 
    rule tile and it will automatically display the correct 
    tile based on the rules we've set up (note the rules 
    enacted at the top of the list overwrite rules below, so 
    make sure rules above don't overwrite rules below unless 
    you want them to)

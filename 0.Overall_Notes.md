[1]UNITY OVERALL INFORMATION

    Unity (Game Engine)
    - A visual interface for creating games
    - Systems of existing code (Blueprints) used to do physics, rendering, audio etc.
    -Reads and runs .cs Files (C# file)

    VScode (IDE)
    - Writes code to tell the game engine what to do
    - More easily write code with tools like Auto-Complete, Colour Coding, syntax error checking etc.
    -Writes .cs Files (C# file)

[2]UNITY UI

    HIERACHY: is the drop down on the left of the page when you open unity, contains the objects rendered by your project and its position on a "hierachy" of objects (which objects extend other objects). For example "Main camera" as a default is an object on all unity projects and is on all "levels" you make of a unity project, You can add or remove a number of sprites, cameras, and objects in your game

    -COMPONENTS: Components are features of various objects in unity, they all have their own preset features

        Types of Components:
            -Sprite: A 2D graphic object obtained from a bitmap, there are basic ones for basic shapes
            (.bmp)image

            -Camera: A camera which represents a screen in the game in the unity engine
    
    GLOBAL AND LOCAL DIRECTIONS

        When manipulating an object, widgets and other components 
        maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z 
        direction, we can change this by switching at the top of the 
        screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the 
        object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
        having new relative local x, y and z directions

        TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE
        transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
        transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis

        we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning
    


[3]C#

    IN C# THE BASIC PRIMITIVES ARE:

        int
        long
        float (6 decimal points)
        double (15 decimal points)
        bool
        string

        they are declared like so:  

        int hitPoints = 20;

        float sped = 3.8f;

        note with other number types other than int we need to specify 
        its a float with "f"


[4]UNITY OBJECTS

    TYPES OF METHODS IN A SCRIPT:

        Start and Update methods initialised at the start of a unity 
        script are "callback methods"

        Start executes when you click "play" on the game once

        Update executes every single frame the game runs

    UNITY INPUT SYSTEMS AND INPUT.GETAXIS()

        We will now begin allowing the player to move components using 
        keyboard inputs (e.g. the arrow keys)

        We do this using the Input object which allows us to define 
        where the input is coming from (e.g the keyboard) and what the 
        inputs would do in the game

        in unity there are two main systems called the "old" sytem and 
        the "new" system, we will initially describe the old system as 
        its easier to instantly pick up but we will discuss the new 
        system later

        The old system is using Input, we then need to go to project 
        settings and determine the input variables name e.g. Horizontal
        and then call that in our script via a string reference

        (quick note if your controls are inverted a quick easy fix is 
        to invert the value by adding a - sign)

    ATTRIBUTES AND "SERIALIZEFIELD"

        We can make our variables available in the inspector in unity 
        (the inspector being where all the component properities are)
        We do this by in our script making variables an "attribute", 
        the attribute SerializeField allows us to "write to disk" 
        information to that variable in the C# script.
        The variable after SerializeField has been added will appear in 
        the inspector under the "script" section for the component
    
    TIME.DELTATIME()

        The issue with updating something every single frame is more
        powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
        computer making the properties of your game different based on 
        how many frames are calculated every second. therefore we need 
        some way to standardise the process across all computers. 
        Therefore we need to use time directly.

        Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) 
        took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
        on a slower computer

        We multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame
        rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
        and slow computer.

        This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

        (As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables
        not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
        you may now need to change these variables as they might be
        too sensitive/insensitive)

[5]COMPONENTS AND PROPERTIES

[6]GAME DESIGN

    -always design the game before writing any code
    -First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible 
    sprites that can appear

    when thinking of game design think of:
    -Player experience (e.g. relaxing, intense, puzzle)
    -Core mechanics (e.g. drive over pickups)
    -Game loop(e.g. find and deliver all packages)

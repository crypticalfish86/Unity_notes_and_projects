[1]HIERACHY 
    
    Hierachy is the drop down on the left of the page when you open unity, contains the objects rendered by your project and its position on a "hierachy" of objects (which objects 
    extend other objects). For example "Main camera" as a default is an object on all unity projects and is on all "levels" you make of a unity project, You can add or remove a 
    number of sprites, cameras, and objects in your game

[2]IMPORTING ASSETS

    You can actually just directly import PNG files into unity to act as 2D sprites, You will definitley learn more about this
    another time as well as how to create your own assets, but for now we will simply use pre-provided assets.
        
[3]IMPORTING PACKAGES

    Go to "Window" on the toolbar and go to "Package Manager", switch "packages" to include the Unity Registry and install the 
    package you want from that list. The package you want depending on its functions and features will now appear in components or when right clicking on the hierachy.

[4]Unity spacial information

    When manipulating an object, widgets and other components maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z direction, we can change this by switching at the top of 
    the screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
    having new relative local x, y and z directions TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
    transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning.

[5]UNITY UNITS

    Unity has "units" of measurement for sizes/distances the units don't mean any real distance, they can represent metres, inches, kilometers etc. However they're a consistent
    measurement of distance that we relatively scale all of our models to. It's good in your project to define how big one "unity unit" is in actual measurements for objects
    on the same plane as each other

    New assets imported to unity default to 100 pixels per unity unit (as in 1 unity unit is equal to a 100x100 pixel image). We can change this in the settings for our assets
    if we want to change how many pixels fit in one unit, this should ideally be consistent across all assets for a consistent
    art style in a project.

    When creating reference objects its good practice to scale everything to the size you want by editing the assets "pixel  per unit". If you want different objects to be different 
    sizes you can then using the scaling tool to edit that but a standard size for all components is useful

    We can switch a component to "snap" to unity unit mode (meaning when you move the component it will always move directly along unity units) by clicking on the object, switching 
    to "global" and then checking the "snap" tool on the same toolbar as the global option

[6]Prefabrications
    
    Prefabs are templates of objects you want to regularly
    use throughout your project. Copies of this prefab we add 
    into our game are called "instances" of that prefab. 
    prefabs allow us to easily load the instaces of the prefab 
    into our game, they also let us edit all instaces of the 
    prefab at once instead of manually having to edit each 
    individual object in the hierachy
    
    
    What you would do to make a prefab is:  
    
        -create an object in the hierachy
        -Drag the object from the hierachy down into your project folder
        -Make and edit your prefab

    Once you've made your prefab in order to make an instance 
    of it in your world:
        -Drag the prefab from your project folder into the world/hierachy
    
    These are all instances of the prefab and when you edit the 
    prefab in the project folder, those changes will translate 
    to all instances of the prefab in the game. If you want 
    changes to just one instance of the object, make the edits/
    changes to the instance in the hierachy instead, any 
    changes we make to instances that we then want to apply to 
    all prefabs we can do by going to "overrides" in the 
    instance inspector and click "apply all" now all changes 
    you made to that instance will be applied to the prefab and 
    any/all instances of that prefab.
    
    Note that if you changed a specific attribute of an 
    instance, and then tried to change the same attribute in 
    the prefab, it will apply this change to all other 
    instances but NOT the instance that you went in and changed 
    in the hierachy. It WILL however change with all other 
    instances for changes to other attributes you edit the 
    prefab with.

    We can instantiate instances of our prefabs both in the 
    unity editor and in our code.

    Prefabs are also good use of memory, especially if you want 
    to use this object many times Prefabs will have all the 
    scripts, components and the same sizes and shapes as each 
    other. We tend to store prefabs in its own folder called 
    "prefabs".

[7] More detailed layering system
    We can usually very simply change the "order in layer"
    in order to put certain assets in front of others,
    However when games get more complicated we need to use the
    layering tool.

    On any game object we can go to "layer" and where it 
    usually says default we can click "add layer" and in 
    "sorting layers" we can create new "layers" and add game 
    objects to those layers down where it says "sorting layer" 
    (note this is a seperate drop down menu to where default 
    was, the thing is called "sorting layer" and its in the 
    "renderer" components instead of on any game object). No 
    matter what now so long as two objects are on different 
    layers, they will intersect/overlap as they should 
    according to the sorting layers

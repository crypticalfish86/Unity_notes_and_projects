HIERACHY 
    Hierachy is the drop down on the left of the page when you open unity, contains the objects rendered by your project and its position on a "hierachy" of objects (which objects 
    extend other objects). For example "Main camera" as a default is an object on all unity projects and is on all "levels" you make of a unity project, You can add or remove a 
    number of sprites, cameras, and objects in your game

    
GLOBAL AND LOCAL DIRECTIONS

    When manipulating an object, widgets and other components maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z direction, we can change this by switching at the top of 
    the screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
    having new relative local x, y and z directions TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
    transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning.

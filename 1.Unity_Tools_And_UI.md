[1]HIERACHY 
    
    Hierachy is the drop down on the left of the page when you open unity, contains the objects rendered by your project and its position on a "hierachy" of objects (which objects 
    extend other objects). For example "Main camera" as a default is an object on all unity projects and is on all "levels" you make of a unity project, You can add or remove a 
    number of sprites, cameras, and objects in your game

[2]IMPORTING ASSETS

    You can actually just directly import PNG files into unity to act as 2D sprites, You will definitley learn more about this
    another time as well as how to create your own assets, but for now we will simply use pre-provided assets.
        
[3]IMPORTING PACKAGES

    Go to "Window" on the toolbar and go to "Package Manager", switch "packages" to include the Unity Registry and install the 
    package you want from that list. The package you want depending on its functions and features will now appear in components or when right clicking on the hierachy.

[4]Unity spacial information

    When manipulating an object, widgets and other components maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z direction, we can change this by switching at the top of 
    the screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
    having new relative local x, y and z directions TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
    transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning.

[5]UNITY UNITS

    Unity has "units" of measurement for sizes/distances the units don't mean any real distance, they can represent metres, inches, kilometers etc. However they're a consistent
    measurement of distance that we relatively scale all of our models to. It's good in your project to define how big one "unity unit" is in actual measurements for objects
    on the same plane as each other

    New assets imported to unity default to 100 pixels per unity unit (as in 1 unity unit is equal to a 100x100 pixel image). We can change this in the settings for our assets
    if we want to change how many pixels fit in one unit, this should ideally be consistent across all assets for a consistent
    art style in a project.

    When creating reference objects its good practice to scale everything to the size you want by editing the assets "pixel  per unit". If you want different objects to be different 
    sizes you can then using the scaling tool to edit that but a standard size for all components is useful

    We can switch a component to "snap" to unity unit mode (meaning when you move the component it will always move directly along unity units) by clicking on the object, switching 
    to "global" and then checking the "snap" tool on the same toolbar as the global option

[1]SERIALIZEFIELD

    We can make our variables available in the inspector for quick modification of values instead of having to change them in the script.
    We do this by in our script by writing [SERIALIZEField] just before our variable datatype, making it an "attribute". 
    SerializeField allows us to "write to disk" directly in the Unity engine, the variable after SerializeField has been added will appear in 
    the inspector under the "script" section for the component

[2]Grouping our serialized fields in the Unity UI
    
    We can add a new attribute above our serialized fields
    called [Header("header_name")]. This will until the 
    next header is given in the next lines will group
    the fields under "header_name" in the inspector

[3]public and private variables in Unity
    public variables can be accessed outside the script they are
    in while private variables can only be accessed inside the
    script they are in.

    In order to access a public variable/function in another script we
    do:

    FindObjectOfType<"ScriptComponentName">()."variable/function you want to call"

    This only works if the variable/function is public.
    
    Note: public is also another way of making a variable 
    available in unity like [SerializeField] however its less
    safe as [SerializeField] doesn't allow other scripts to 
    accidentally modify a variable.


[4]Accessing private variables using getters

    We can give a private function the ability to be read using a
    public getter function, This is good for reading Serialized fields 
    in other scripts(which are still technically private variables)
    
    in C# a getter function looks like this:

    public "variable_type" GetVariable(){

        return "variable";
    }

[5]Adding a set raneg to serialized fields

    Simply add the attribute: 
    
    [Range(min, max)]

    after serializeField before the variable in order to create 
    a maximum and minimum range to set an attribute to in the 
    unity inspector.

    Full code would look like this:

    [SerializeField] [Range(min, max)] variable_name;

    This will also add a "slider" in our inspector for us to 
    easily see the minimum and maximum

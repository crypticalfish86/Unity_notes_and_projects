[1]What are scriptable objects

    Scriptable objects are a way of storing data in our game outside of scripts or game objects.

    This helps us keep data out of our scripts and helps us 
    save memory by storing all of our data in one place without 
    needing to attach it to an object in the game.

    They're lightweight and convinient and useful to use for 
   player/enemy/game stats

[2] Creating a scriptable object
    
    Create a new C# in unity and where it extends from the 
    class "MonoBehaviour", change it so it extends from 
    "ScriptableObject"

    Scriptable objects tend to contain variables with data inside of them so fill them with variables containing the data you want.

    Make sure all these variables are [SerializeField]'s but
    also, if we're putting long paragraphs of text or large
    amounts of data into these fields, we may want to increase
    the size of the box we enter information into in unity.

    For this we not only do [SerializeField] but we also have a 
    new attribute called [TextArea("min lines", "max lines")]. 
    Where min lines is the minimum lines of the field in the 
    unity inspector and max lines is the maximum amount of 
    fields in the unity inspector

[3] Creating a scriptable object template for reuse in project
    
    If we wanted to create a template for us to use multiple
    of the exact same type of scriptable objects in a unity project, we'd create a template scriptable object, and
    before the public class declaration we'd also add [CreateAssetMenu()]. 

    It would look like so:

        [CreateAssetMenu("Menu_name", "File_Name")]
        public class "class_name" : ScriptableObject{
            //class details
        }
    
    In the create section of the of the project/assets field
    (where we for example create new C# Scripts) We now have a 
    new option in that drop down menu to create "Menu_name" 
    which will spawn an exact replica class of our script 
    template with all its methods, variables and other data 
    under the default name "File_name"

    Make sure to fill all variables you want to include in your scriptableObject template with default values

[1]HOW TO USE MORE COMPLEX SPRITE SHAPES

    Sprite shapes allow us to make more complex shapes than basic squares and circles.

    First to make a sprite shape go to "create 2D sprite, then go to "sprite shape" and click a closed shape if you want a shape 
    thats completely enclosed

    On sprite shapes now we can click "edit spline" to start editing our shape to our hearts content, we can move any of the nodes or even add more nodes by clicking places.
    To delete nodes simply click on a node and hit the delete button while it's selected.


[2]SPRITE PROFILES

    If we're not just importing assets we want our shapes to have textures and skins instead of being a basic shape.

    In order to give you sprite shape a texture go to "create" in the right click of the assets section of the page, then 2D then 
    "create sprite shape profile" (make sure to name your shape accordingly)

    You can now click on this sprite profile and do all sorts of edits to the profile. You can add sprite assets to the sprites and texture to fill the edges and inner layer.

    Make sure to add this profile to any shape you want to have this profile.

[3]Sprite Editor

    Just to note, so far you've used prepackaged sprites instead of your own assets, there is a sprite editor which you use to edit the textures that make up your sprite. 

    Also when importing assets make sure to pay attention to your "Wrap mode", make sure its on repeat especially if its on a big 
    object and the fill texture has multiple colours instead of just one.

[4]MAKING SPRITES OUT OF MULTIPLE ASSETS

    Add a parent asset, remove any rendering shapes, then add the assets in as children under the parent asset, move each 
    individual piece around to shape your sprite and so long as you just move the parent asset everything should stay in place, add 
    physics to the parent asset and manipulate that to the shape of your sprite. 

    Make sure the middle of your sprite assets is roughly where the centre of the parent object is (you can do this by clicking on 
    all child objects and moving them all to the centre of the parent)

    Also make sure any physics applies to the whole sprite by adding physics at the parent level

[5]Changing the image associated with a sprite component
    
    To change the image associated with a sprite all you have to do is get the image component of a sprite and change it out for another sprite

    like so:

    [SerializeField] image;

    spriteObject.sprite = image

    this will change spriteObjects image to whatever you add to the serialized field

[6]Derendering/filling only part of a sprite image
    
    We can choose to derender parts of an image leaving other
    parts still completely rendered by changing the Image type
    from simple to "filled" this gives us a slider which will
    say what ratio of the image do you want to display and what
    amount you want to derender. There are mutliple options
    for derendring parts in "fill method", either radially
    like a circle, from the top, from the bottom etc.

[1]UI Canvas

    UI referring to "User Interface" refers to everything 
    related to text, buttons, menus, minimaps etc. Anything
    that the user can interact with that isn't part of the game 
    world itself is reffered to as the UI.

    In unity UI elements live on something called a "Canvas"
    which exists in something called "Screen space" which 
    exists in a seperate world to "world space" where the game 
    world is located. In the game world space will be captured
    by the camera, and screen space will be overlayed on top.

    Do note that screen space has a completely different frame
    of reference so the distances and object locations must be 
    treated differently to worldspace objects. A canvas will 
    view (0,0,0) As the centre of the screen.

    To add a canvas to a unity project in the hierachy, right 
    click on the hierachy go to UI -> Canvas to add a new 
    canvas. This creates a new canvas and "Event System" (we 
    will go into what event systems are later).

    We can do numerous things like adding images or other child
    objects to our canvas but they all must be under the 
    hierachy of our canvas to interact with the canvas
 
[2]Anchor points for Objects in a canvas

    We can add objects as children of a canvas for them to 
    appear in a canvas. Objects give us various
    default "anchor presets" for us to use to put the objects 
    "central position" in the "top-left, top right, top centre, 
    bottom left" etc.When we preset an object to one of these, 
    it becomes the new relative (0,0,0) for our object, for 
    example if you pick top left then 0,0,0 will be the top 
    left corner of the screen

    We can also change the "pivot" for objects which are where
    the centre of the object is considered to be and where it 
    will pivot around relative to the object itself. This 
    sounds a bit paradoxical but the centre of the object can 
    be set to not the centre of the actual object but for 
    example on the corners. We can even have an anchor preset 
    for our pivot to put the pivot in the top left, top right 
    etc. parts of our object as well, which makes (0,0,0) now 
    centred around the top left of the object as that is now 
    considered the "centre"

    We can choose to give an object multiple anchor points and 
    the ability to "stretch the object" to cover whole parts of 
    the screen. When given two or more anchor points (0,0,0) is 
    now the intersection in space of all the anchor points.

    We stretch images with Shift + Alt -> click the stretch you want


    ALL POSITIONS IN SCREEN SPACE ARE A LOT MORE RELATIVE TO 
    EACH OTHER THAN IN WORLD SPACE

[3]Adding images to screen space

    In the image component we can add a "source image" as an
    asset. We can also change the "alpha value" in the colour
    option to make images more faded in and out

[4]Text in UI with TextMeshPro
    
    TextMeshPro is a package that lets us add and manipulate 
    text in the UI.

    Installing TextMeshPro:
        -Go to Window
        -Scroll down to TextMeshPro
        -Go to Import Essential TMP Rescources
        -Click Import
        -We should now be able to use textmesh pro
        -(Doing this will also add a TextMeshPro folder to assets)

    Now that we have installed TextMeshPro we can add it
    to the hierachy in the UI section. We now have a text box
    which we can move around like any other object as well as in
    the TextMeshPro-Text(UI) component we can change the text
    as well as numerous other standard features of text.

    (NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO EDIT TEXTMESHPRO COMPONENTS IN A 
    SCRIPT YOU NEED TO IMPORT: using TMPro)

    We can download fonts from the internet on various websites,
    once we found a good font, what we can do is download it,
    add it to the textmeshpro font file. We wont be able to use
    it yet but to add it to the game follow these instructions

    Adding a new font:
        -Download it from the internet and add to fonts file
        -Go to Window -> TextMeshPro -> Font Asset Creator
        -Drag your font sourfec file to "Source font file"
        -Click generate Font atlas
        -Click save as
    
    TextMeshPro has numerous features that regular text
    boxes don't, if you want a certain effect using textmeshpro
    e.g. underlay, colour gradient etc. Theyre much easier to
    implement than the normal text tool. So look up things
    or look at prior unity projects using text mesh pro for
    examples.

[5]Buttons
    
    Buttons are another important component in a UI. We can
    Add buttons under UI into the canvas hierachy (along with a 
    text mesh pro component as a child of the button if we want)

    We can toggle its interactableness in the buttons "button" 
    component, and scripts will be used to determine what 
    happens when we click the button in the "On Click" section 
    of the button component.

[6]Layout tools with "Layout group"
    Layout groups are a way of laying out objects in unity in
    a descending list/grid/any type of format you want.

    All objects that you want to conform to the layout group
    must be children of the type of layout group that you want.
    There are vertical, horizontal and grid layout component 
    types.

    Children of your layout group (even when adding new objects) will automatically conform to what layout you want

    Layout groups allow us to add padding, spacing between objects in the group as well as the size of the objects directly

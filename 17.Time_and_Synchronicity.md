[1]Frame rate independent movements

        The issue with updating something every single frame using Update(){} is more powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
        computer making the properties of your game different based on how many frames are calculated every second. We Therefore need 
        some way to standardise the process across all computers, to do this we can multiply our values by the timing of frames directly.

        Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
        on a slower computer.

        When we multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
        and slow computer. This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

        (As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
        you may now need to change these variables as they might be too sensitive/insensitive)

[2]Making a timer
    
    A timer in unity is simple, to have a counting up timer
    simply += Time.deltaTime() in Update(), to have a counting 
    down timer simply -= Time.deltaTime() in Update(). 

    This is because as said in the last section, Time.deltaTime
    measures the time in ms between the last frame and the current frame, this means it will accuratley count down
    frame by frame in real time so it's super useful to use
    to make a simple real time timer.

    In order to make a sped up or slowed down timer simply
    multiply the timer by the amount you want to speed up
    or slow down

[3]Coroutines
        Coroutines are ways to start processes and then 
        continue others while that process is still underway. 
        It is a way to do asynchronous programming in Unity.

        In order to start a coroutine we run:

                StartCoroutine("Method"());

        (Note we're calling the method in StartCoroutine)

        our "Method" must return IEnumerator (IEnumerator is 
        basically a list of asynchronous routines)

        In order to give a method a delay now, we run inside 
        the block:

                yield return new WaitForSecondsRealtime(time);
        
        This in the lines of the method makes the method wait 
        for the number of seconds specified before continuing 
        onto the next line (yield basically means "wait until this condition is met and then return to this method)

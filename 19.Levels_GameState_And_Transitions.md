[1]Restarting A level/Scene

    When we die or finish a game we sometimes want to be able
    to respawn/restart a level. We will use the SceneManager 
    class in order to do actions like this.

    To do this we will first have to import SceneManager into
    the script we want to use, in C# we do it with the "using"
    keyword making our import look like this:

        using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
    
    We now have access to SceneManager in this script.

    In order to restart the level we can use SceneManager.LoadScene("SceneName"). We can find the Name of our current
    Scene in File -> Build Settings. We then just load the scene
    we are currently playing.

    Alternatively we can add the scene index so for our first scene we can simply add SceneManager.LoadScene(0)

    Loading/reloading a scene reinstantiates the player + all 
    other objects and scripts

[2]Adding new Scenes
    Go to File -> Build settings and simply "Add open Scenes" after making the scene you want

[3]Getting the current scene you are in
    
    To get the current scene you are in you do:

        SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex;

        This will return the index of the scene the script is 
        currently running in.

        In order to get the total number of scenes we would run:
            SceneManager.sceneCountInBuildSettings;
        
        This gives us the total number of scenes as an int value

[4]Ensuring things persist independent of level/scene (Game Session Controller)

    In order to keep track of/ ensure certain things persist 
    from one scene to the next we have to make a "Game Session 
    Controller" which is an object that persists on level loads/
    reloads.

    This starts as a gameobject in the hierachy with an 
    attached script

    First things first to set up a game session controller we 
    need to not use start but instead "Awake" which is a script 
    that runs once when the game object is initialized (Instead 
    of start which runs every time a script is loaded).

    In awake we need to ensure when we load a new scene that a new gamesession controller is not initialized:

    Awake(){
        int numGameSessions = FindObjectsOfType<ScriptName>().Length

        if (numGameSessions > 1){
            Destroy(gameObject)
        }
    }

    This will ensure there will only ever be one gameSessions 
    script.

    Next we need to ensure when we load/reload a scene that the 
    gameobject doesn't get destroyed. We can do this with 
    DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject).

    This prevents the gameobject being destroyed and gets 
    carried over to the next scene instead of being deleated on 
    a new scene load/reload

    so the full awake method looks like this:

    Awake() {
        int numGameSessions = FindObjectsOfType<ScriptName>().Length

        if (numGameSessions > 1){
            Destroy(gameObject)
        }
        else{
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject)
        }
    }

    This lets our single game object persist throughout the 
    levels/scenes of our game without ever being destroyed 
    (note we can still destroy it ourselves manually in code 
    using Destroy())

    We now have a script that will continue running in the 
    background of every single scene that gets loaded and we 
    can fill this script with all the data and methods that 
    need to be kept track of over the course of the whole game.

    THIS WILL WORK FOR BOTH THE GAMEOBJECT AND ANY OF ITS 
    CHILDREN

[5]Scene persistence(maintaining scene state on scene reload)
    
    We sometimes want certain objects/states to persist on 
    scene reload e.g. we don't want a player to be able to pick 
    up the same coin they already did on a previous life in a 
    sidescroller.

    To do this we simply add all the objects we want persisting
    and put them as children of a gameobject with the exact 
    same script as in chapter 4 of this slide

[6] Quitting an application

    A hard exit for a game would be to use

    Application.Quit();

    This is a very "hard" exit, for most games we don't use this
    but for our basic ones we do.

[2]ATTRIBUTES AND "SERIALIZEFIELD"

    We can make our variables available in the inspector for quick modification of values instead of having to change them in the script.
    We do this by in our script by writing [SERIALIZEField] just before our variable datatype, making it an "attribute". 
    SerializeField allows us to "write to disk" directly in the Unity engine, the variable after SerializeField has been added will appear in 
    the inspector under the "script" section for the component

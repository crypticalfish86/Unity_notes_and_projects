[1]Common methods in scripts:
    
    -Start(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" when you click "play" on the game once
    
    -Update(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" every single frame the game runs
    
    -Debug.Log("String"): Prints string to console
    
    -Invoke("StringOfNameOfMethod", "delay(Seconds)"): Executes "nameofmethod" after a certain delay (note first argument is a string of the name of the method, not the method itself)


[2]ATTRIBUTES AND "SERIALIZEFIELD"

    We can make our variables available in the inspector for quick modification of values instead of having to change them in the script.
    We do this by in our script by writing [SERIALIZEField] just before our variable datatype, making it an "attribute". 
    SerializeField allows us to "write to disk" directly in the Unity engine, the variable after SerializeField has been added will appear in 
    the inspector under the "script" section for the component

[3]public and private variables in Unity
    public variables can be accessed outside the script they are
    in while private variables can only be accessed inside the
    script they are in.

    In order to access a public variable/function in another script we
    do:

    FindObjectOfType<"ScriptComponentName">()."variable/function you want to call"

    This only works if the variable/function is public.
    
    Note: public is also another way of making a variable 
    available in unity like [SerializeField] however its less
    safe as [SerializeField] doesn't allow other scripts to 
    accidentally modify a variable.

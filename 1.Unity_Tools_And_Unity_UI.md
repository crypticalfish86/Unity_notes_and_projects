[1]HIERACHY 
    
    Hierachy is the drop down on the left of the page when you open unity, contains the objects rendered by your project and its position on a "hierachy" of objects (which objects 
    extend other objects). For example "Main camera" as a default is an object on all unity projects and is on all "levels" you make of a unity project, You can add or remove a 
    number of sprites, cameras, and objects in your game

[2]IMPORTING ASSETS

    You can actually just directly import PNG files into unity to act as 2D sprites, You will definitley learn more about this
    another time as well as how to create your own assets, but for now we will simply use pre-provided assets.
        
[3]IMPORTING PACKAGES

    Go to "Window" on the toolbar and go to "Package Manager", switch "packages" to include the Unity Registry and install the 
    package you want from that list. The package you want depending on its functions and features will now appear in components or when right clicking on the hierachy.

[4]Unity spacial information

    When manipulating an object, widgets and other components maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z direction, we can change this by switching at the top of 
    the screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
    having new relative local x, y and z directions TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
    transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning.

[5]UNITY UNITS

    Unity has "units" of measurement for sizes/distances the units don't mean any real distance, they can represent metres, inches, kilometers etc. However they're a consistent
    measurement of distance that we relatively scale all of our models to. It's good in your project to define how big one "unity unit" is in actual measurements for objects
    on the same plane as each other

    New assets imported to unity default to 100 pixels per unity unit (as in 1 unity unit is equal to a 100x100 pixel image). We can change this in the settings for our assets
    if we want to change how many pixels fit in one unit, this should ideally be consistent across all assets for a consistent
    art style in a project.

    When creating reference objects its good practice to scale everything to the size you want by editing the assets "pixel  per unit". If you want different objects to be different 
    sizes you can then using the scaling tool to edit that but a standard size for all components is useful

    We can switch a component to "snap" to unity unit mode (meaning when you move the component it will always move directly along unity units) by clicking on the object, switching 
    to "global" and then checking the "snap" tool on the same toolbar as the global option


[6]HOW TO USE MORE COMPLEX SPRITE SHAPES

    Sprite shapes allow us to make more complex shapes than basic squares and circles.

    First to make a sprite shape go to "create 2D sprite, then go to "sprite shape" and click a closed shape if you want a shape 
    thats completely enclosed

    On sprite shapes now we can click "edit spline" to start editing our shape to our hearts content, we can move any of the nodes or even add more nodes by clicking places.
    To delete nodes simply click on a node and hit the delete button while it's selected.


[7]SPRITE PROFILES

    If we're not just importing assets we want our shapes to have textures and skins instead of being a basic shape.

    In order to give you sprite shape a texture go to "create" in the right click of the assets section of the page, then 2D then 
    "create sprite shape profile" (make sure to name your shape accordingly)

    You can now click on this sprite profile and do all sorts of edits to the profile. You can add sprite assets to the sprites and texture to fill the edges and inner layer.

    Make sure to add this profile to any shape you want to have this profile.

[8]Sprite Editor

    Just to note, so far you've used prepackaged sprites instead of your own assets, there is a sprite editor which you use to edit the textures that make up your sprite. 

    Also when importing assets make sure to pay attention to your "Wrap mode", make sure its on repeat especially if its on a big 
    object and the fill texture has multiple colours instead of just one.

[9]MAKING SPRITES OUT OF MULTIPLE ASSETS

    Add a parent asset, remove any rendering shapes, then add the assets in as children under the parent asset, move each 
    individual piece around to shape your sprite and so long as you just move the parent asset everything should stay in place, add 
    physics to the parent asset and manipulate that to the shape of your sprite. 

    Make sure the middle of your sprite assets is roughly where the centre of the parent object is (you can do this by clicking on 
    all child objects and moving them all to the centre of the parent)

    Also make sure any physics applies to the whole sprite by adding physics at the parent level

[10]Changing the image associated with a sprite
    
    To change the image associated with a sprite all you have to do is get the image component of a sprite and change it out for another sprite

    like so:

    [SerializeField] image;

    spriteObject.sprite = image

    this will change spriteObjects image to whatever you add to the serialized field


[11]Change Resolution view of our game
    
    In game view in the top centre of the screen there are buttons like scale and resolution (which is by default set to "free aspect"). Set your game view to be the resolution you want

[12]Prefabrications
    
    Prefabs are set objects and items you want to regularly
    use throughout your project, What you would do is create
    one of these objects in the game world, then drag that
    object in the hierachy to the assets folder, you can then
    take it from the assets folder and put it somewhere in the 
    world that you want.

    Prefabs will have all the scripts, components and the same 
    sizes and shapes as each other.

    We tend to store this in its own folder called prefabs

[13]Derendering/filling only part of an image
    
    We can choose to derender parts of an image leaving other
    parts still completely rendered by changing the Image type
    from simple to "filled" this gives us a slider which will
    say what ratio of the image do you want to display and what
    amount you want to derender. There are mutliple options
    for derendring parts in "fill method", either radially
    like a circle, from the top, from the bottom etc.

[14]Grouping our serialized fields in the Unity UI
    
    We can add a new attribute above our serialized fields
    called [Header("header_name")]. This will until the 
    next header is given in the next lines will group
    the fields under "header_name" in the inspector

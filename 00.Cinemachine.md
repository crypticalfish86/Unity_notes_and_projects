Several virtual cameras can be run at once that are interpreted by the cinemachine logic system and the logic system decides to
project onto the "main camera" which is the computer screen
the user views. The cinemachine logic system is a component on the main camera

To initiate the cinemachine logic system on the main camera simply add it as a component or try adding a virtual camera.

For a basic following virtual camera change the body to 
"framing transposer" meaning we are trying to "frame" a 
particular thing in our world. Then make it follow the object 
you want to frame. There will by default be some "smoothing/
easing" so its not so jarring when quick moves are made.

We also probably want our object more to the left of the screen 
so we'd change in the body section of the virtual camera 
"Screen X" and "Screen Y" to our preffered values to that the 
camera will follow the object in a way that keeps it in the 
ideal part of the screen.

There are many many other features that we will add here when 
they come up.

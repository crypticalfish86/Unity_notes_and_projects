[1]Colliders

    Colliders are a component on an object which detects when two colliders overlap each other in the world. If we want to code 
    an event in 2D when two colliders collide we'd use OnCollisionEnter2D(){} which looks like so:

    public void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other) {
            //execute code in this block
        }

    other represents information about the object that this object has bumped into and allows you to determine
    what type of object you've bumped into and if any different blocks of code will execute based on the type of object
    that has collided with another object

[2]Rigid bodies
    A rigid body is a component which gives an object "mass" and "substance, physics now gets applied to it (like drag, buoyancy, gravity etc.).
    When an object with a rigid body component crashes into other colliders (that aren't triggers which we will talk about next). It will crash
    into it and not move forward. 

    If a rigid body crashes into another rigid body both objects physics will be simulated and will move based on each objects mass. For
    this to work an object needs to have both a rigid body and collider component.

    We can also change the collision detection on a rigid body between discrete  and continious. discrete uses less processing 
    power however at high speeds has the tendency to phase through objects, contious has less of a chance to do this however it 
    uses more processing power, so use one or the other based on the game/object.

[3]Triggers
    There is a third kind of collision object called a "trigger" which allows an object to phase through it as if it was just an 
    image however a trigger will "log" when an object has overlapped with it and can have a script written to trigger 
    some sort of event. A trigger is created by adding a collider to an object and then in the collider component simply checking 
    the "Is Trigger" box.

    A trigger box can be a very good invisible object which isused to determine when the player has "entered an area" or
    triggered some sort of invisible trap

    If we want an event to happen when a collision occurs between an object and a trigger we would use OnTriggerEnter2D
    
    It looks like so:
        public void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collision2D other){
            //execute code in this block
        }

    
    other represents information about the object that this object has ran over the trigger into and allows you to determine what type of object 
    you've bumped into and if any different blocks of code will execute based on the type of object that has collided with another object

[4]EDGE COLLIDERS

    to add a collider to a sprite shape we would add a "Edge Collider 2D". This gives our sprite shape an edge collision box 
    that automatically conforms to the sprite shape.

[1] Particle System Information

    Particle systems in unity have two main components,

    1.Particles - The visible particles that are given behaviour
    2.Emmiters - Where the particles are emmited from (what we place in the world)

    Each Individual particle is NOT an object in the game, the
    Emmiter is the game object

    The particle System is a component that gets added to a game
    object. We Use "Modules" for controlling the behaviour of 
    the particles. Modules are behaviours present on the 
    particle System component (There are many different 
    behaviours that can be added to particle effects in unity).


[2]Adding particle effects to scenes
    
    Particle effects can be added independently to a scene or be a component of a larger sprite/object in a hierachy.

    Just right click on the hierachy and scroll down to
    "Effects" -> Particle Systems to create an effect,
    There is a default particle effect in Unity if we add a 
    particle system directly into the world. We can 
    then just manipulate it like any other object (with 
    a few added features we will go into now).

    If we want to add particle effects to moving objects,
    its best to add them as a component of an object. For
    Objects that don't move its best to have them as a 
    child object of the greater object

[3]Common module settings for common particle effects
    Your will generally just play around with effects until
    you get exactly what you want but here are a few small
    shorthand effect specs you can use depending on your needs


    Short KABOOM (Celebratory confetti):
        -Main Module:
            -Looping = OFF //particles wont loop
            -Duration = 0.20 //duration of effect is short
            -Start Lifetime = 0.20 - 0.30  && "Random between two constants"//particles have low variable lifespan 
            -Start Speed = 10 - 50 && "Random between two constant //High speed of particles coming out
            -Start Colour = Random between two colours (white+ red) //White and red confetti
        -Emmision:
            -Rate over time = 500 //large amount of particles
        -Renderer:
            -Select Material = Sprites-Default //Squares for confetti
        -Shape:
            -Shape = Cone //Cone shape up into the air

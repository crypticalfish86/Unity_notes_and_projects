COLLIDERS, RIGID BODIES AND TRIGGERS

Collider: A component which detects when two colliders overlap

Rigid body: A component which determines that this object has
"mass" or "substance" and physics should be applied to it

First things first we need to add a "rigid body" to the player
component

Next we need to add a "collider" component to both
the player car and object to crash into we should be adding a 
2D collider of the same shape the image is


If we want the object the player crashes into to move/bounce around we need to also add a "rigid body" as a component to 
that object too.

There is a third kind of collision object called a "trigger" 
which allows an object to phase through it as if it was just an 
image however a trigger will "log" when an object has 
overlapped with it and can have a script written to trigger 
some sort of event. A trigger is created by adding a collider 
to an object and then in the collider component simply checking 
the "Is Trigger" box.

A trigger box can be a very good invisible object which is
used to determine when the player has "entered an area" or
triggered some sort of invisible trap


ON_COLLISION_ENTER_2D()

    OnCollisionEnter2D is a method that executes
    when the object this script is attached to
    collides with something else.

    It looks like so:

        public void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other) {
            //execute code in this block
        }

    other represents information about the object that 
    this object has bumped into and allows you to determine
    what type of object you've bumped into and if any different
    blocks of code will execute based on the type of object
    that has collided with another object

ON_TRIGGER_ENTER_2D()

    OnTriggerEnter2D is a method that executes

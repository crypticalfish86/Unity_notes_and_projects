[1]Restarting A level/Scene

    When we die or finish a game we sometimes want to be able
    to respawn/restart a level. We will use the SceneManager 
    class in order to do actions like this.

    To do this we will first have to import SceneManager into
    the script we want to use, in C# we do it with the "using"
    keyword making our import look like this:

        using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
    
    We now have access to SceneManager in this script.

    In order to restart the level we can use SceneManager.LoadScene("SceneName"). We can find the Name of our current
    Scene in File -> Build Settings. We then just load the scene
    we are currently playing.

    Alternatively we can add the scene index so for our first scene we can simply add SceneManager.LoadScene(0)

[2]Adding new Scenes
    Go to File -> Build settings and simply "Add open Scenes" after making the scene you want

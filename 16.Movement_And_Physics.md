[1]Coding actual movement with translation/position
    
    In 2D unity movements are implemented via transform.translate(x,y,z) where x, y and z are floats. Transform.Translate returns as a "Vector3" datatype (x, y, z), which represents 
    movements in either direction. You would usually put a translation after an input into the Update(){} function so that an object would translate across the game by this much in x,y,z every frame. 
    
    If you want an object or camera to teleport to a certain position immediatley you would change the transform.position of the object the script is attached to.
    If you wanted to add extra coords in any direction you can directly add a Vector3 datatype to another like so:

    transform.position = new Vector3 ("x,y,z" values) + new Vector3 ("x,y,z" values)

[2]Colliders

    Colliders are a component on an object which detects when 
    two colliders overlap each other in the world. If we want 
    to code 
    an event in 2D when two colliders collide we'd use 
    OnCollisionEnter2D(){} which looks like so:

    public void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other) {
            //execute code in this block
        }

    other represents information about the object that this object has bumped into and allows you to determine
    what type of object you've bumped into and if any different blocks of code will execute based on the type of object
    that has collided with another object

    We can also trigger an event for when two objects
    come OUT of collision from one another (as in they
    intially collided and have moved away from each other
    so their collision boxes no longer touch).  We do this
    with OnCollisionExit2D which looks like so:

    public void OnCollisionExit2D(Collision2D other){
        //execute code in this block
    }

    other represents information about the object that this 
    object has left collision with and allows you to determine
    what type of object you've bumped into and if any different 
    blocks of code will execute based on the type of object
    that has left collision with another object

    Collider components:

    Collider methods:                
        Collider2D.IsTouchingLayers(LayerMask.GetMask("layer")):
            Returns a boolean value for if object collides
            with another collider component of an object on
            the "LayerMask" (The layer mask is just a reference
            to a certain set of layers which can refer to one
            specific layer if we do LayerMask.GetMask
            ("layer_name") where "layer_name" is a string reference to the layer we want to get the mask of)

[3]Rigid bodies
    A rigid body is a component which gives an object "mass" and "substance, physics now gets applied to it (like drag, buoyancy, gravity etc.).
    When an object with a rigid body component crashes into other colliders (that aren't triggers which we will talk about next). It will crash
    into it and not move forward. 

    If a rigid body crashes into another rigid body both objects physics will be simulated and will move based on each objects mass. For
    this to work an object needs to have both a rigid body and collider component.

    We can also change the collision detection on a rigid body between discrete  and continious. discrete uses less processing 
    power however at high speeds has the tendency to phase through objects, contious has less of a chance to do this however it 
    uses more processing power, so use one or the other based on the game/object.

    NOTE THAT IF YOU WANT SOME SORT OF COLLIDER BUT DON'T WANT 
    PHYSICS IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION THAT THE COLLIDER YOU WANT 
    WOULD CAUSE, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO FREEZE ROTATION OR POSITION 
    ON THE X, Y AND Z AXIS

    Rigid body components:
        rigidBody2D.velocity(x, y)
            velocity is a Vector2 component that determines the movement of the player every frame in the x and y direction
    
    Rigid body methods:


[4]Triggers
    There is a third kind of collision object called a "trigger" which allows an object to phase through it as if it was just an 
    image however a trigger will "log" when an object has overlapped with it and can have a script written to trigger 
    some sort of event. A trigger is created by adding a collider to an object and then in the collider component simply checking 
    the "Is Trigger" box.

    A trigger box can be a very good invisible object which isused to determine when the player has "entered an area" or
    triggered some sort of invisible trap

    If we want an event to happen when a collision occurs between an object and a trigger we would use OnTriggerEnter2D
    
    It looks like so:
        public void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collision2D other){
            //execute code in this block
        }

    
    other represents information about the object that this object has ran over the trigger into and allows you to determine what type of object 
    you've bumped into and if any different blocks of code will execute based on the type of object that has collided with another object

[5]EDGE COLLIDERS

    to add a collider to a complex sprite shape we would add a "Edge Collider 2D". This gives our sprite shape an edge collision box 
    that automatically conforms to the sprite shape.


[6]Coding Rotation with torque

    The force that rotates an object in unity is called "torque". Torque is a feature on an objects rigid body, so in order to
    edit it we first need to get the component like we did before,
    
    we can then do: 

    rigidbody.AddTorque(torqueamount)

    To add rotation either clockwise or anti clockwise (positive numbers for anticlockwise, negative numbers for clockwise).

[7]USING THE SURFACE EFFECTOR

    An effector is a feature of the physics engine that adds various effects in the game (e.g buoyancy, floating conveyer 
    belt etc.), The specific effector we will use is the Surface Effector 2D. 

    Add it to the surface you want to act as a conveyeer belt and anything with physics (a rigid body) will be pushed along on 
    its surface (we can use this to simulate converyer belts, ice, slippery surfaces etc.)

    Change the speed to whatever you want the surface to thave the effect for (positive values for left to right and negative 
    values for right to left)

    Force scale refers to how much gravity effects the speed ofthe object on the conveyer belt, a higher number means
    less effect by gravity

[8]Adding collision to tilemaps
    
    In order to add collision to tiles, you would need to add a 
    collider to the tilemap itself in the hierachy instead of 
    individual tiles.

    You would add a "Tilemap Collider 2D", this adds collision 
    to all tiles in a tilemap.

    There is an issue with just adding a collider, there is an 
    extremely small gap between collision in tiles that objects 
    occasionally get "caught on". This can be fixed by adding a 
    second component called:

    Composite Collider 2D

    You then click the box that states "used by composite" 
    which causes the composite collider to be used, making a 
    single collision object across conjoined tiles.

    This component also automatically adds a RigidBody 2D Which 
    you need to set the body type to static in order to prevent 
    it moving through the world (You wouldnt do this if you 
    want moving platforms).

[9]The physics 2D settings
    
    The physics 2D settings in project settings contains the 
    rules for the physics of your entire physics world.

    One of the main things in here at the bottom is the 
    collision matrix (a bunch of tick boxes between all layers 
    in a matrix). Clicking them on or off toggles whether 
    certain layers collide with other layers

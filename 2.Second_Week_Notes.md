-A top down delivery driving game
-Picking up packages on the map and delivering them to customers
-Picking up a package will change the colour of your vehicle when you pick them up
-will have "boost areas" to speed up car and obstacles which slow down car

GAME DESIGN (always design the game before writing any code)
-First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible sprites that can appear

5 different components:
-Player car (player sprite)
-Obstacles (bump into and stop speed)
-Speed boost (speed up when sprite goes over)
-Package (changes colour of car and allows you to deliver to customer)
-Customer (deliver package to customer)

Game mechanichs we need:
-Driving car forwards and backwards
-Turn car left and right
-Increase speed when driving over "speed ups"
-Decrease speed when bump into "slow downs"
-Pick up packages when drive over them
-Deliver package when drive over customer
-Change car colour

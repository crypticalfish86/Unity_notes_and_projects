DELIVERY DRIVER
-A top down delivery driving game
-Picking up packages on the map and delivering them to customers
-Picking up a package will change the colour of your vehicle 
when you pick them up
-will have "boost areas" to speed up car and obstacles which slow down car

Game will include the begginings of:
-Variables
-Conditionals
-Methods
-Triggers
-Colliders
-References(references to components allowing us to access 
those components properties)

GAME DESIGN (always design the game before writing any code)
-First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible 
sprites that can appear

when thinking of game design think of:
-Player experience (e.g. relaxing, intense, puzzle)
-Core mechanics (e.g. drive over pickups)
-Game loop(e.g. find and deliver all packages)

5 different components:
-Player car (player sprite)
-Obstacles (bump into and stop speed)
-Speed boost (speed up when sprite goes over)
-Package (changes colour of car and allows you to deliver to customer)
-Customer (deliver package to customer)

Game mechanichs we need:
-Driving car forwards and backwards
-Turn car left and right
-Increase speed when driving over "speed ups"
-Decrease speed when bump into "slow downs"
-Pick up packages when drive over them
-Deliver package when drive over customer
-Change car colour

METHODS
methods execute blocks of code that make our game do things (also called functions)

We can use the methods already available to us in unity or make 
entirely new ones ourselves

When we CREATE a method, we are giving it a name and saying 
what it should do. 

When we CALL a method, we are saying "do the thing now please"

types of methods in a script:

Start and Update methods initialised at the start of a unity 
script are "callback methods"

Start executes when you click "play" on the game once

Update executes every single frame the game runs

GLOBAL AND LOCAL DIRECTIONS

When manipulating an object, widgets and other components 
maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z 
direction, we can change this by switching at the top of the 
screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the 
object change in relation to the global directions, it now 
having new relative local x, y and z directions

TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE
transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis

we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning

VARIABLES

Issue atm is that the car is going at a fixed amount of speed 
and rotation. Our values are hardcoded into "start" and 
"update" So we need to add in variables in order to be able to 
begin being able to change these values.

in c# the basic primitives are:

int
long
float (6 decimal points)
double (15 decimal points)
bool
string

they are declared like so:  

int hitPoints = 20;

float sped = 3.8f;

note with other number types other than int we need to specify 
its a float with "f"

ATTRIBUTES AND "SERIALIZEFIELD"

We can make our variables available in the inspector in unity 
(the inspector being where all the component properities are)

We do this by in our script making variables an "attribute", 
the attribute SerializeField allows us to "write to disk" 
information to that variable in the C# script.

The variable after SerializeField has been added will appear in 
the inspector under the "script" section for the component

UNITY INPUT SYSTEMS AND INPUT.GETAXIS()

We will now begin allowing the player to move components using 
keyboard inputs (e.g. the arrow keys)

We do this using the Input object which allows us to define 
where the input is coming from (e.g the keyboard) and what the 
inputs would do in the game

in unity there are two main systems called the "old" sytem and 
the "new" system, we will initially describe the old system as 
its easier to instantly pick up but we will discuss the new 
system later

The old system is using Input, we then need to go to project 
settings and determine the input variables name e.g. Horizontal
and then call that in our script via a string reference

(quick note if your controls are inverted a quick easy fix is 
to invert the value by adding a - sign)

TIME.DELTATIME()

The issue with updating something every single frame is more
powerful computers will calculate more fps than a slower 
computer making the properties of your game different based on 
how many frames are calculated every second. therefore we need 
some way to standardise the process across all computers. 
Therefore we need to use time directly.

Time.DeltaTime() tells us how long each frame (in milliseconds) 
took to execute, on a fast computer the value will be lower than
on a slower computer

We multiply something by Time.deltaTime it makes our game "frame
rate independent", meaning the game behaves the same on a fast
and slow computer.

This concept allows us to move an object an equal number of "units" per second

(As a quick note if you've been simulating a game with variables
not frame rate independent and then multiply by time.deltatime 
you may now need to change these variables as they might be
too sensitive/insensitive)

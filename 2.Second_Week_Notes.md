DELIVERY DRIVER
-A top down delivery driving game
-Picking up packages on the map and delivering them to customers
-Picking up a package will change the colour of your vehicle when you pick them up
-will have "boost areas" to speed up car and obstacles which slow down car

Game will include the begginings of:
-Variables
-Conditionals
-Methods
-Triggers
-Colliders
-References(references to components allowing us to access those components properties)

GAME DESIGN (always design the game before writing any code)
-First make a "gameplay overview screen" with all possible sprites that can appear

when thinking of game design think of:
-Player experience (e.g. relaxing, intense, puzzle)
-Core mechanics (e.g. drive over pickups)
-Game loop(e.g. find and deliver all packages)

5 different components:
-Player car (player sprite)
-Obstacles (bump into and stop speed)
-Speed boost (speed up when sprite goes over)
-Package (changes colour of car and allows you to deliver to customer)
-Customer (deliver package to customer)

Game mechanichs we need:
-Driving car forwards and backwards
-Turn car left and right
-Increase speed when driving over "speed ups"
-Decrease speed when bump into "slow downs"
-Pick up packages when drive over them
-Deliver package when drive over customer
-Change car colour

METHODS
methods execute blocks of code that make our game do things (also called functions)

We can use the methods already available to us in unity or make entirely new ones ourselves

When we CREATE a method, we are giving it a name and saying what it should do. 

When we CALL a method, we are saying "do the thing now please"

types of methods:

Start and Update methods initialised at the start of a unity script are "callback methods"

Start executes when you click "play" on the game once

Update executes every single frame the game runs

GLOBAL AND LOCAL DIRECTIONS

When manipulating an object, widgets and other components maintain their positions in relation to the "global" x, y and z direction, we can change this by switching at the top of the screen to "local" making the actual "front/back/sides" of the object change in relation to the global directions, it now having new relative local x, y and z directions

TRANSFORM.ROTATE AND TRANSFORM.TRANSLATE
transform.Rotate() rotates our car on the x, y z axis
transform.Translate() moves our car on the x,y,z axis

we can combine these two methods to simulate our car turning

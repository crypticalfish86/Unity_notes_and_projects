[1]Common methods in scripts:

    -Awake(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" once, When the game object its attached to is initialized (and never run again after that)
    
    -Start(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" once, just before the first frame of the game when you click "play"
    
    -Update(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" every single frame the game runs
    
    -Debug.Log("String"): Prints string to console
    
    -Invoke("StringOfNameOfMethod", "delay(Seconds)"): Executes "nameofmethod" after a certain delay (note first argument is a string of the name of the method, not the method itself)

[2]CODING PLAYER INPUTS

    Input.GetAxis() will have a value of either -1, 0 or 1 depending on the predefined Input. The Input object which allows us to define 
    where the input is coming from (e.g the keyboard) and our script dictates what the inputs would do in the game

    For GetAxis to determine where to get input from, to do this in Unity go to Edit -> Projects Settings -> Input Manager.
    Then We need to find the right type of input (e.g. Vertical, Horizontal etc.) and pass in the keyword of its name as a string
    to Input.GetAxis("String here"). This will now give us a positive, negative or neutral value for us to use in our script to code what player input does
    (quick note if your controls are inverted a quick easy fix is to invert the value by adding a - sign)

[3]Adding player inputs as a component and making input systems

    To add player inputs as a component which is far more 
    convinient, we need to import a package called InputSystem 
    in the package manager, (TO USE ANYTHING IN THIS SECTION IN 
    A SCRIPT WE ALSO NEED TO ADD: using UnityEngine.InputSystem)

    We can instead add a "player input" component on the player 
    object. We can then add an input system (Which is a file we 
    can create in unity, this usually goes into a seperate 
    folder called "input systems").

    we can create an input system and add various "actions" 
    such as move, jump, look etc. as well as setting which 
    buttons correspond to those actions. Actions can also have 
    sub actions (e.g. move would have 4 sub actions, WASD). We 
    set which buttons correspond to actions by choosing the 
    "path", most of the time it will listen to a key on the 
    keyboard or button press of the mouse, we do this by adding 
    a "binding" to the action in the input system. 
    (note we can have a couple default Input systems by clicking 
    "create actions" on player input component)

    Once you've set up this system, add it to the "player 
    input" on the player object, We also now need to open 
    "input settings" and create an "input settings asset" which 
    creates an input settings asset in the project folder. we 
    can now use the inputs outputs (which can be a value that 
    ranges from values of -1, 0 and 1, a bool in the form of a 
    button which just determines that its pressed and more 
    things) in our scripts to code effects of those inputs in 
    the game.

    In the behaviour section of the "player input" component it 
    will list all the various new event listeners such as OnMove
    (InputValue inputValue), OnJump(InputValue inputValue), 
    OnLook(InputValue inputValue) etc(InputValue represents the 
    value of the input you've set when player input is received 
    for various keys pressed). 
    
    All of these can now be used on a script on the player 
    object in order to execute a piece of code when player 
    input triggers these methods.

[1]Common methods in scripts:

    -Awake(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" once, When the game object its attached to is initialized (and never run again after that)
    
    -Start(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" once, just before the first frame of the game when you click "play"
    
    -Update(){"code"}: Executes functions in "{}" every single frame the game runs
    
    -Debug.Log("String"): Prints string to console
    
    -Invoke("StringOfNameOfMethod", "delay(Seconds)"): Executes "nameofmethod" after a certain delay (note first argument is a string of the name of the method, not the method itself)

[2]CODING PLAYER INPUTS

    Input.GetAxis() will have a value of either -1, 0 or 1 depending on the predefined Input. The Input object which allows us to define 
    where the input is coming from (e.g the keyboard) and our script dictates what the inputs would do in the game

    For GetAxis to determine where to get input from, to do this in Unity go to Edit -> Projects Settings -> Input Manager.
    Then We need to find the right type of input (e.g. Vertical, Horizontal etc.) and pass in the keyword of its name as a string
    to Input.GetAxis("String here"). This will now give us a positive, negative or neutral value for us to use in our script to code what player input does
    (quick note if your controls are inverted a quick easy fix is to invert the value by adding a - sign)

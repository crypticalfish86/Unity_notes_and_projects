[1]How animation works in unity

    We first have to find the animator window, go to
    window -> animation -> animator

    this opens the animator window.

    To learn how animation works in unity there is some terminology you have to learn:

        Animator Component - Assigns animations to GameObjects through an animator controller(a component on our game object)

        Animator Controller - The Arrangement of animations and transitions (state machine)

        Animation - Specific pieces of motion the object does

        Sprite renderer - Displays the 2D sprite on the screen

    
    Here is a step by step guide to setting up a certain animation:
        
        -Import spritesheet and slice
        
        -Add sprite renderer to object
            -Add a default sprite so object is visible
        
        -add animator to game object
            -Component called "Animator"
        
        -Create animator contorller
            -In project files:
                -Create -> Animator controller
        
        -Create animation clip
            -Find game object animation frames
            -Select all frames -> right click -> Create -> Animation
        
        -add animation to animator controller
            -Drag animation into animator controller
            -connect to Entry(if not done by default)
            -Make sure to loop it if you want it to loop
        
        -Assign animation controller to animator component of game object
            -Simply add it to the controller section in component
        
    After all these steps your animation should play, The animator controller and whether the animation loops will determine when/how the animation will play

[2]Animation states and transitions
    
    The animator controller controls what animations play 
    through "states". in order to change states we need to make 
    a transition from one animation state to another in the 
    animator controller, we can do this by right clicking on a 
    state in the controller, clicking "make transition" and 
    drag the arrow to the state you want to make a transition 
    to (note if you want a back and forth transition draw an 
    arrow back too).

    If we click on the arrow it will bring up in the inspector 
    details about the transition state from the two animations, 
    we can control things like "transition duration" where the 
    prior animation is still playing, and "exit time" where 
    once conditions stop being true it will revert back to 
    prior animation (I think, please review this part).

    We can create parameters in the animation controller (for 
    example create a bool for when a player is running to 
    trigger the transition to the running animation)

    Once we've created our parameters we can add those 
    parameters to the "conditions" tab of the transition 
    between the two animation states (make sure you add the 
    relevant parameters required on the transition back to the 
    state you came from if this is a 2 way animation).

    There is a way to set animations to transition to from any state 
    and that is to make a transition from the preset "any state" state 
    to the animation you want. This saves you from needing to make all 
    states transition to a certain state.

[3]Animation state in code
    
    Remember we set up parameters in our animator 
    controller to determine the animation of a game object, how 
    we flip these in code is what we're going to talk about now.

    first as always we need to get the animator component:

    Animator animator = GetComponent<Animator>();

    The next thing we need to do is based on the type of parameter:

    bool (true or false): 

        use the SetBool function on the animator component:

        animator.SetBool("bool_name_string", bool_value);

        This flips the bool that has the exact same name to bool_value
    
    Trigger (uncancellable bool, one way):

        use the SetTrigger function on the animator component:
        
        animator.SetTrigger("trigger_name_string");

        This activates the trigger (it can't be unactivated)

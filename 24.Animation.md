[1]How animation works in unity

    We first have to find the animator window, go to
    window -> animation -> animator

    this opens the animator window.

    To learn how animation works in unity there is some terminology you have to learn:

        Animator Component - Assigns animations to GameObjects through an animator controller(a component on our game object)

        Animator Controller - The Arrangement of animations and transitions (state machine)

        Animation - Specific pieces of motion the object does

        Sprite renderer - Displays the 2D sprite on the screen

    
    Here is a step by step guide to setting up a certain animation:
        
        -Import spritesheet and slice
        
        -Add sprite renderer to object
            -Add a default sprite so object is visible
        
        -add animator to game object
            -Component called "Animator"
        
        -Create animator contorller
            -In project files:
                -Create -> Animator controller
        
        -Create animation clip
            -Find game object animation frames
            -Select all frames -> right click -> Create -> Animation
        
        -add animation to animator controller
            -Drag animation into animator controller
            -connect to Entry(if not done by default)
            -Make sure to loop it if you want it to loop
        
        -Assign animation controller to animator component of game object
            -Simply add it to the controller section in component
        
    After all these steps your animation should play, The animator controller and whether the animation loops will determine when/how the animation will play

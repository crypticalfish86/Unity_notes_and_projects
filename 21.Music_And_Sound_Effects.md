[1] Playing sound in Unity
    For audio we need an "Audio listener" which is like a 
    virtual microphone that receives sounds and then plays
    the sounds it hears through your computers speakers.

    Audio listeners tend to be added as a component to cameras 
    in video games but don't need to be.

    We also need an "Audio source" which allows us to play
    the actual audio the listener is picking up and also
    allows us to adjust its settings.

    Audio Sources tend to be added as a component to triggers
    or other objects in the world that make that sound

    Finally we need an "Audio Clip" which contains the audio
    data that is to be played (e.g. mp3, Wav etc.)

    This can be downloaded from the internet or made yourself

[2]Adding multiple sound effects to object with PlayOneShot("Sound")

    Add an AudioSource to the object but don't add a specific sound file
    to the AudioSource.
    
    Serialize a field in a script attached to the object, add the sound 
    you want in unity to that field and then play it with PlayOneShot like so:

    [SerializeField] AudioClip audioclip; //add your audio clip to this field

    GetComponent<AudioSource>().PlayOneShot(audioclip); //gets the audiosource to play the audioclip

    PlayOneShot looks through your object to find that exact reference
    attached to your object in some way and then plays the contents
    of that audio file. (note an audio file in unity is reffered to as )

[3]Instantiating a single sound effect to play immediatley

    We can instantiate a sound effect, have it play and then
    have it be deleted by doing:

    AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(audioClip, position, volume);

    This sound effect is deleted immediatley after use so use it on the trigger of some condition e.g enemy death

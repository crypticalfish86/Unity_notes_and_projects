[1]HOW TO USE GetComponent

    Objects can have a multitude of components, we can access a specific component and it's properties to view/change using 
    GetComponent<Component> Where "Component" is the component of the object this script is attached to (notice how its represented as a generic like you use in java).

    e.g. 

    SpriteRenderer sprite = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();

    If the object this script is attached to has a component called SpriteRenderer, then it will now be stored in sprite and we can access its properties.
    (Note: Make sure this component is in the correct scope in a script for you to use)

    Also note that the game has to "start" first and sprite
    cant store a static object, so getting your actual 
    componenent needs to be done in Start() or Update().

[2]Using FindObjectOfType
    FindObjectOfType is another approach we can use to
    set a reference to a component or object. It's good
    for when we only have one object of that type in your
    game (as it will just get the first one  of that type in 
    our game).

    Find object type works like this:

    ObjectType object;

    Start(){
        object = FindObjectOfType<ObjectType>()
    }

    object now stores a reference to that object/component for 
    us to manipulate and use in the script. Remember it will
    only pick the first one it finds so only use this if
    there is one of those objects/components in your game.

    Note both whole objects and components are "types".
    We can even call names of scripts this way to execute
    parts of scripts in other scripts

[3]Tags
    
    Tags in unity are labels we give to objects that we can use to determine what "type of object" that object is, for example the 
    player object gets the "player" tag or a delivery box gets the "delivery" tag, that tag is then available in our code as a 
    string which we can then use to trigger conditional logic on what happens when an object of this type interacts with an 
    object of another type.

    The object tag is available via:  Object.tag and will be a string. We can even make custom tags ourselves in unity or 
    use the various generic tags unity gives us by default.

[4]How to Destroy/remove Objects

    Sometimes we want an object to be destroyed/despawned from the world. We do this by calling Destroy().

    Destroy() takes two arguments, the first argument is the object you want to destroy through the format Object.
    gameObject. And the second argument is and optional argument of how long of a delay in seconds before destroying the object, if 
    this isn't provided the object will be destroyed immediatley.
